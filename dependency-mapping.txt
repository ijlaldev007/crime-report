# Dependency Mapping for Crime Report Application

## File Structure to README.md Mapping

The file-structure.txt maps to the README.md as follows:

1. **Authentication (EPIC 1)**
   - Maps to: src/models/User.ts
   - Maps to: src/app/api/users/route.ts

2. **User Roles & Access Control (EPIC 2)**
   - Maps to: src/models/User.ts (role property)

3. **Report Filing Module (EPIC 3)**
   - Crime Reports:
     - Maps to: src/app/api/crime-reports/route.ts
     - Maps to: src/models/CrimeReport.ts

4. **Reports Viewer (EPIC 4)**
   - Maps to: src/app/page.tsx (for viewing reports)

5. **Admin Module (EPIC 5)**
   - To be implemented

6. **UI/UX & Responsiveness (EPIC 6)**
   - Maps to: src/app/globals.css
   - Maps to: src/app/layout.tsx

7. **Data Structure (EPIC 7)**
   - Maps to: src/models/
   - Maps to: src/lib/mongodb.ts (database connection)

8. **Quality & Testing (EPIC 8)**
   - To be implemented

## Task Dependencies

1. **Authentication Dependencies**:
   - Task 1.1 (User Registration) must be completed before Task 1.2 (User Login)
   - Task 1.1 must be completed before EPIC 3 (Report Filing Module)
   - Task 1.2 must be completed before EPIC 5 (Admin Module)

2. **User Roles Dependencies**:
   - Task 2.1 (Role Differentiation) depends on EPIC 1 (Authentication)
   - Task 2.1 must be completed before EPIC 5 (Admin Module)

3. **Report Filing Dependencies**:
   - Task 3.1 (File Crime Report) depends on EPIC 1 (Authentication)
   - Task 3.1 depends on MongoDB connection being properly set up

4. **Reports Viewer Dependencies**:
   - Task 4.1 (View Reports) depends on EPIC 3 (Report Filing Module)
   - Task 4.1 depends on MongoDB collections being properly set up

5. **Admin Module Dependencies**:
   - Task 5.1 (Admin Access) depends on EPIC 2 (User Roles & Access Control)
   - Task 5.2 (Status Update) depends on EPIC 3 (Report Filing Module)

6. **UI/UX Dependencies**:
   - Task 6.1 (Mobile-First Design) should be implemented alongside all UI components
   - Task 6.2 (Navigation & Routing) depends on the overall application structure

7. **Data Structure Dependencies**:
   - Task 7.1 (MongoDB Collections) should be implemented before EPIC 3 (Report Filing Module)
   - Task 7.1 is implemented in src/models/ and src/lib/mongodb.ts

8. **Testing Dependencies**:
   - Testing depends on all other EPICs being implemented
